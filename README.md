# [Simple Carousel](https://github.com/andrevvalle/simple_carousel)

>This is a repository where I am applying some javascript concepts for my study. I intend to improve the slide of the code and leave it more dynamic, feel free to contribute :)

***Running the application:***

1. Install [HarpJs](http://harpjs.com/).

2. Init Harp server:

  ```sh
  $ harp server
  ```

3. Your application will be running on http://localhost:9000/www

4. Make your changes in **_development** folder:

5. To test your changes need to build the project:

  ```sh
  $ harp compile _development www
  ```

6. Now just need to send me a pullrequest :)
